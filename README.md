### **Sample Question 1:**

Using the 3 tables clinic1_data, clinic2_data, and clinic3_data above, construct a SQL query (any dialect - Postgres, MariaDB, MSSQL, etc) that matches patient information based on age, sex, race/ethnicity, and zipcode (you can make reasonable assumptions about which columns from which tables map to each other) and returns vaccination data merged for different dates (including PatientID from clinic1_data, and the columns PatientAge, PatientSex, PatientZIP, VaccineType, and VaccineDate).
